### Demo Flow (5 minutes)

   - Show cluttered Turno/Breezeway screenshot vs clean Claro interface

2. **Problem Demo** (1 min)
   - Point to unassigned jobs in sidebar
   - Show same-day turn with ⚠ icon
   - "This is your daily headache, right?"

3. **Solution Demo** (2 min)
   - Drag job to cleaner slot - "Manual is simple"
   - Click AI Suggest - "But AI is smarter"
   - Show scoring reasoning - "It considers distance, workload, skills"
   - One-click assign - "Done in seconds"

4. **Mobile Demo** (1 min)
   - Resize to mobile or open on phone
   - "Your cleaners see this in the field"
   - Show touch-friendly interface

5. **Differentiation** (30 sec)
   - "Nobody else has AI suggestions"

   - "Free for 3 months, then 50% off for life"
   - "Interested?"

## 📊 Feedback Questions to Ask

### During Demo
- "Is this how you currently think about scheduling?"
- "What's missing that you need daily?"
- "How much time would this save you?"

### After Demo
- "Scale of 1-10, how likely would you use this?"
- "What would make it a 10?"
- "What would you pay for 70% time savings?"
- "Who else should I show this to?"

## 🔥 Objection Handlers

### "We already use [Competitor]"
> "Great! That means you understand the value. Claro is specifically built for same-day turns and AI optimization - features [Competitor] doesn't have. Plus, we'll help you migrate for free."

### "AI suggestions seem gimmicky"
> "Let me show you the math..." *[Show scoring breakdown]* "It's considering 5 factors you mentally juggle. Even if it saves 2 minutes per assignment, that's 2 hours a day."

### "Too expensive for small operation"
> "Actually, small operations benefit most. You don't have a dispatcher, right? This IS your dispatcher. It pays for itself with one prevented missed cleaning."

### "We need [specific feature]"
> "Great feedback! As a beta partner, you'll shape the product. We can prioritize that feature for you. What else would you need?"
