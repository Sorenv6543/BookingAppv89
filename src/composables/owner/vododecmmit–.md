## Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into main … (7c6125f)

Standardized booking date/time field naming across the codebase

Renamed booking date/time fields from `guest_arrival_date`/`guest_departure_date` and `guest_arrival_time`/`guest_departure_time` to `checkin_date`/`checkout_date` and `checkin_time`/`checkout_time`. Updated related logic, UI, type definitions, and database migrations for consistency and improved clarity.

### Changes
- Renamed booking fields: `guest_arrival_date` → `checkin_date`, `guest_departure_date` → `checkout_date`, `guest_arrival_time` → `checkin_time`, `guest_departure_time` → `checkout_time`.
- Updated all usages in forms, components (e.g., `BookingForm.vue`, `AdminBookingForm.vue`), composables, stores, and utility functions.
- Modified type definitions in `src/types/booking.ts` to reflect new naming and made times required.
- Added property default time fields (`default_checkout_time`, `default_checkin_time`) and supporting logic/utilities (`src/utils/timeDefaults.ts`, SQL migrations).
- Refactored Supabase migrations to rename columns, update constraints, and maintain data integrity.
- Adjusted validation, sorting, and filtering logic to use new field names.

### Impact
- Ensures booking logic and UI consistently align with property owner workflow (checkout → cleaning → checkin).
- Affects all components, composables, and database queries referencing booking dates/times.
- Requires schema migrations and data transformation for backward compatibility.
- Potential downstream effects for integrations or legacy code expecting original field names.
- Improves maintainability and reduces confusion in future development and debugging.
