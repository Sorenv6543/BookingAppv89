Refactor booking date properties for clarity and consistency … (d248801)
Refactored booking date/time property names for clarity and consistency

All instances of guest_departure_date/guest_arrival_date and related time fields were renamed to checkout_date/checkin_date and checkout_time/checkin_time throughout the codebase and database. This aligns code and database schema with property owner terminology and enhances maintainability.

Changes
Renamed booking fields:
guest_departure_date → checkout_date
guest_arrival_date → checkin_date
guest_departure_time → checkout_time
guest_arrival_time → checkin_time
Updated all affected Vue components, Pinia stores, composables, utility functions, test utilities, and type definitions.
Revised Supabase migration scripts to update existing data, constraints, and indexes to the new column names.
Adjusted validation, filtering, and business logic functions to use the new property names.
Improved error handling and logging in booking-related logic.
Impact
Improves code clarity by matching field names to user mental models.
May introduce breaking changes for any code or integrations relying on the old property names (guest_departure_date, guest_arrival_date, etc.).
Database schema and constraints are updated; migrations must be applied in production/staging.
All booking-related features and tests must be verified to ensure correct behavior after property renaming.
No significant performance impact expected, but extensive refactoring increases the risk of regression if not thoroughly tested.
