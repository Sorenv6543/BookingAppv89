Using my Vuettify RAG API context (1,990 documentation chunks), help me:

1. Create OwnerSidebar.vue component
2. Use role-based navigation patterns
3. Implement responsive design
4. Follow TypeScript best practices

Current context:
- Building TASK-060 from tasks_v2.md
- Need owner-specific navigation only
- Integration with existing OwnerQuickActions

Suggest the most appropriate Vuettify components and provide working examples.
