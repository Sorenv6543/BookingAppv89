## I'm building a property cleaning scheduler app.

> Read @project_summary.md and @tasks.md to understand project architecture and current task structure.
> Check @repomix-output.md for current project state and existing implementations.

## For each task:
1. **Context First**: Use Context7 tool to research relevant documentation from @context7_techstack_ids.md before starting
2. **Plan**: Use sequential thinking to break down the task and plan implementation
3. **Implement**: Build the feature following established patterns from @project_summary.md
4. **Integrate**: Ensure implementation fits the broader project architecture and Map collection patterns
5. **Update**: Change task status from "Not Started" to "Complete" in TASK.md
6. **Document**: Add detailed notes about implementation decisions and any challenges
7. **Verify**: Check off task with [x] and ensure it enables future dependent tasks
## Key Patterns to Follow:
- Use Map collections for all state management
- Follow the Home.vue central orchestrator pattern
- Maintain turn vs standard booking distinction in all business logic
- Reference existing composables and stores for consistency
- Implement proper TypeScript typing and error handling

## Before Marking Complete:
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Follows established naming conventions
- [ ] Integrates with existing stores/composables
- [ ] Includes basic error handling
- [ ] Updates any dependent interfaces/types

## Critical Project Concepts:
- Turn bookings = urgent, same-day turnovers between guests
- Standard bookings = regular recurring cleanings
- Priority calculation based on checkout → checkin time window
- All state uses Map collections, not arrays

- UI Store manages modals, sidebars, loading states
