> Read @project_summary.md to understand the context of the project. look at the task.md for what has been done and what stil needs to be fone
> Examine @repomix-output.md, look at existing patterns, implementations and state flow to understand the current context of the project

## For this Task..

1. Plan: While using sequential thinking to break down the problem and plan implementation, look for the relevant keywords within the scope
of the task so context 7 can search for the correct combination of tech documentation.   
refer to @context7_techstack_ids.md for usage examples

1. Implement: the task within the context of the codebase and patterns from @project_summary.md

2. Integrate: Ensure implementation fits the broader project architecture and Map collection patterns


## Key Patterns to Follow:
- 
- Follow the HomeAdmin.vue and OwnerAdmin.vue central orchestrator pattern
- Maintain turn vs standard booking distinction in all business logic
- Reference existing composables and stores for consistency
- Implement proper TypeScript typing and error handling

## Before Marking Complete:
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Follows established naming conventions
- [ ] Integrates with existing stores/composables
- [ ] Includes basic error handling
- [ ] Updates any dependent interfaces/types
