"Whenever I ask a technical question about a specific software library, framework, or API, you must use web_search and/or web_fetch tools. First, use web_search to find the official documentation or latest information about the package, then use web_fetch to retrieve the actual documentation pages before generating any code. Prefer official documentation over your internal training data to avoid hallucinations."
