"Whenever I ask a technical question about a specific software library, framework, or API, you must use the context7 MCP tools. First, call resolve-library-id to find the correct package, then query-docs to retrieve the latest version-specific documentation before generating any code. Prefer official documentation over your internal training data to avoid hallucinations."
