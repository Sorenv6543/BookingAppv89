# Custom Ctrl + C Command for Vite Process (2026-02-04 03:33Z)

You can configure the terminal to send a custom command when pressing `Ctrl+C` using the **terminal.integrated.autoReplies** setting, but this won't work for your use case since `Ctrl+C` is meant to interrupt processes, not run new commands.

Instead, you can create a keyboard shortcut that runs the `pkill` command in the terminal:

1. Open Keyboard Shortcuts JSON using **Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)** command


2. Add this keybinding to the file:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+k",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
    "args": { "text": "pkill -f \"vite --host\"\u000D" },
    "when": "terminalFocus"
}
```


This binds `Ctrl+Shift+K` (or any key you prefer) to send the kill command to the terminal. The `\u000D` is the Enter key.

**Note:** Overriding `Ctrl+C` in the terminal is not recommended as it's essential for interrupting running processes. If you still want to use `Ctrl+C`, you would need to add `"-workbench.action.terminal.copyAndClearSelection"` to the **terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell** setting and create a custom keybinding, but this will break the standard terminal interrupt behavior.

what about ctrl + Alt + space bar?

That keybinding should work great! Add this to your VS Code keybindings.json:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+alt+space",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
    "args": { "text": "pkill -f \"vite --host\"\u000D" },
    "when": "terminalFocus"
}
```

**To add it:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
2. Add the keybinding object to the array

Now when you're focused in the terminal and press `Ctrl+Alt+Space`, it will kill the Vite dev server.
