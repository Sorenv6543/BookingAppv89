# Vite module not found error resolution (2026-02-03 21:41Z)

/fix Cannot find module 'vite' or its corresponding type declarations.

The error "Cannot find module 'vite'" indicates that the Vite package is not installed or its types are missing. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Install missing dependencies** - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in your terminal to ensure all dependencies from `package.json` are installed.

2. If Vite is missing entirely, install it:
   
```
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```


3. If only types are missing, ensure you have TypeScript support:
   
```
   npm install @types/node --save-dev
   ```


4. **Restart the TypeScript language server** to refresh IntelliSense after installing packages.

You can also use the **Quick Fix** command to see available automatic fixes for this error.



Alternatively, use **Install Missing Dependencies** to let VS Code detect and install missing packages.
