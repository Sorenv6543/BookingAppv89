## Explanation of `lint-staged` Configuration

This configuration block defines how **lint-staged** should process files before they are committed to your Git repository. Lint-staged is a tool that runs linters (code quality checkers) only on files that are staged for commit, rather than the entire codebase—making pre-commit checks much faster.

The pattern `"*.{ts,vue}"` is a glob pattern that matches any file ending in `.ts` (TypeScript) or `.vue` (Vue single-file components). When you stage files matching this pattern for a Git commit, lint-staged will automatically run the command `"eslint --fix"` on them.

The `--fix` flag tells ESLint to automatically correct any fixable issues it finds (like formatting problems, missing semicolons, or import order). If ESLint encounters errors that it cannot auto-fix, the commit will be blocked, prompting you to manually resolve those issues before proceeding.

This setup is typically used alongside a Git hook manager like **Husky**, which triggers lint-staged during the pre-commit phase. Together, they help maintain consistent code quality across your team by preventing poorly formatted or problematic code from entering the repository.
