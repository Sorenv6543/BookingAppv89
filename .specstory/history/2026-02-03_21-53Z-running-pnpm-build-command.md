# Running pnpm build command (2026-02-03 21:53Z)

I don't currently have access to terminal tools to run commands. You can run the build command yourself by executing:

```bash
pnpm build
```

(Note: I noticed you typed "buile" - the correct command is "build")

If you'd like me to be able to run terminal commands, please enable terminal tools in your VS Code Copilot settings.
