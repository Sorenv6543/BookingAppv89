# Vite-plugin-pwa module not found error (2026-02-03 21:05Z)

_**User (2026-02-03 21:05Z)**_

/fix Cannot find module 'vite-plugin-pwa' or its corresponding type declarations.

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-opus-4.5)**_

The error indicates that the `vite-plugin-pwa` package is not installed in your project. You need to install the missing dependency.

1. Open the integrated terminal using ``Ctrl + ` ``.

2. Run the following command to install the package:
   
```bash
   npm install -D vite-plugin-pwa
   ```


   Or if you're using yarn:
   
```bash
   yarn add -D vite-plugin-pwa
   ```


3. If TypeScript still shows the error after installation, you may also need to install the types or restart the TypeScript server using the **TypeScript: Restart TS Server** command.

i delete my package.lock file and my node_modules folder

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-opus-4.5)**_

Since you deleted your `package-lock.json` and `node_modules` folder, you need to reinstall all dependencies. Looking at your workspace, you're using **pnpm** (based on `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will reinstall all dependencies including `vite-plugin-pwa` and regenerate the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file. After installation completes, the TypeScript error should be resolved.
