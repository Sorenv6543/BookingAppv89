I'll help you fix the issues in your VS Code agent file. Let me first read the current file to see what needs to be corrected. I can see the issues:

1. **Indentation errors** on line 6 - the line starts with a space before `tools:`
2. **Unsupported attribute text** - the descriptive text after the tools array should be in the `description` field or removed, not inline with the attribute

Here's the corrected version:

```chatagent
---
name: revieew
description: Describe what this custom agent does and when to use it.
argument-hint: The inputs this agent expects, e.g., "a task to implement" or "a question to answer".
tools: ['vscode', 'execute', 'read', 'agent', 'edit', 'search', 'web', 'todo']
---
Define what this custom agent does, including its behavior, capabilities, and any specific instructions for its operation.
```

The changes made:
1. Removed the leading space before `tools:` (fixing indentation)
2. Removed the explanatory text "specify the tools this agent can use. If not set, all enabled tools are allowed." from the tools line (this text was being treated as an unsupported attribute)

The file should now validate correctly in VS Code.
