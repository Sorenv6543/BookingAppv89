The `launch.json` file has invalid JSON syntax. The first few items in the `configurations` array are standalone strings instead of being part of a configuration object. Here's the fixed version:

````json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Chrome against localhost",
            "url": "http://localhost:3080",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
````

**What was wrong:**
- Lines 4-7 had loose strings (`"chrome"`, `"launch"`, etc.) that weren't part of any object
- These appeared to be duplicates of the properties already defined in the configuration object below

The fix removes the duplicate strings and keeps only the properly structured configuration object.
