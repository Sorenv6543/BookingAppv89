This error indicates that the `pinia` package is not installed or its types are missing. Here's how to fix it:

1. Open the integrated terminal using the **Toggle Terminal** command.


2. Install Pinia and its dependencies by running:

```
npm install pinia
```


3. If you're using TypeScript and still see the error after installation, you may need to restart the TypeScript server using the **TypeScript: Restart TS Server** command.


4. If the issue persists, verify that your `node_modules` folder exists and contains `pinia`. You can also try running **Extensions: Install Missing Dependencies** to ensure all workspace dependencies are installed.
