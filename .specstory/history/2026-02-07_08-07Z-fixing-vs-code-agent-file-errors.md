I'll help you fix the issues in your VS Code agent file. Let me first read the file to see what needs to be corrected. I can see the issues in your agent file. Here are the problems and the corrected version:

**Issues:**
1. Line 6 has incorrect indentation (it starts with a space)
2. Line 6 has the attribute value text mixed with the descriptive comment
3. The text "specify the tools this agent can use..." should be a comment, not part of the attribute

Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
---
name: revieew
description: Describe what this custom agent does and when to use it.
argument-hint: The inputs this agent expects, e.g., "a task to implement" or "a question to answer".
tools: ['vscode', 'execute', 'read', 'agent', 'edit', 'search', 'web', 'todo']
---
Define what this custom agent does, including its behavior, capabilities, and any specific instructions for its operation.
```

**Changes made:**
1. Removed the leading space before `tools:` on line 6
2. Removed the explanatory text "specify the tools this agent can use. If not set, all enabled tools are allowed." from the attribute line
3. The `tools` attribute now only contains the array value

The file should now validate correctly as a VS Code agent file.
