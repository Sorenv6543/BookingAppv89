> Read @project_summary.md and @tasks.md to understand **role-based multi-tenant architecture** and current task structure.
> Check @repomix-output.md for current project state and existing implementations.

## For each task:
1. **Context First**: Use Context7 tool to research relevant documentation from @context7_techstack_ids.md before starting
2. **Plan**: Use sequential thinking to break down the task and plan im*role-based considerations**
3. **Implement**: Build the feature following established **role-based patterns** from @project_summary.md
4. **Integrate**: Ensure implementation fits the **multi-tenant architecture** and Map collection patterns
5. **Test**: Create/update **role-specific tests** and use demo components for verification
6. **Update**: Change task status from "Not Started" to "Complete" in tasks.md
7. **Document**: Add detailed notes about implementation decisions, **role-specific features**, and any challenges
8. **Verify**: Check off task with [x] and ensure it enables future dependent tasks

## Key Patterns to Follow:

### **Role-Based Architecture Patterns**
- **Multi-Tenant Design**: Property owners (30-40 clients) vs cleaning business admin interfaces
- **Data Scoping**: Owner sees only their data, admin sees all data across all clients
- **Role-Specific Orchestrators**: HomeOwner.vue vs HomeAdmin.vue (not generic Home.vue)
- **Component Separation**: owner/, admin/, shared/ folder structure
- **Security Awareness**: Frontend filtering for UX, document need for backend RLS

 Use Map collections for all state management
 Follow the Home.vue central orchestrator pattern
 Maintain turn vs standard booking distinction in all business logic
 Reference existing composables and stores for consistency
 Implement proper TypeScript typing and error handling

 Before Marking Complete:
[ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
[ ] Follows established naming conventions
[ ] Integrates with existing stores/composables
[ ] Includes basic error handling
[ ] Updates any dependent interfaces/types
