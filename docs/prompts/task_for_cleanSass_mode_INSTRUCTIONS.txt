## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Study project architecture in @project_summary.md
- Review current task in @tasks.md
- Research documentation with Context7 tool
- Break down implementation steps with sequential thinking

### 2. Implementation Phase
- **Build in the correct sequence**:
  1. Routing structure first
  2. Dumb components (UI only)
  3. Smart components (Business logic)
  4. Home.vue orchestrator last
- **For each component**:
  - Examine existing components for patterns
  - Use Map collections for all state
  - Maintain turn vs standard booking distinction
  - Reference existing composables and stores
  - Add TypeScript typing

### 3. Integration Phase
- Connect components through Home.vue orchestrator
- Follow the data flow: Dumb → Home → Smart
- Ensure all UI state managed through UI Store
- Test component communication paths

### 4. Verification Phase
- Run TypeScript compilation
- Verify business logic (especially turn vs standard)
- Test CRUD operations
- Check proper store integration
- Update task status in TASK.md

## Core Architectural Principles
- **State**: Maps, not arrays
- **Logic**: Separate business logic from UI
- **Flow**: Home.vue as central orchestrator
- **Priority**: Turn bookings > Standard bookings
