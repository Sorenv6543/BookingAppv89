## What This Fix Does

1. ✅ Creates all missing enum types:
   - `user_role` (owner, admin, cleaner)
   - `booking_type` (standard, turn)
   - `booking_status` (pending, scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
   - `property_type` (apartment, house, condo, townhouse)
   - `pricing_tier` (basic, standard, premium, luxury)
   - `priority_level` (low, normal, high, urgent)
   - `theme_preference` (light, dark, system)

2. ✅ Fixes the trigger function with proper security

3. ✅ Re-enables RLS

4. ✅ Shows verification results

## Expected Result After Running

You should see output like:
```
NOTICE: Created enum type: user_role
NOTICE: Created enum type: booking_type
...
✅ SUCCESS: All enum types created and trigger function fixed!
```

Then a table showing all 7 enum types with their values.

## If It Still Fails

Check the Supabase logs for the specific error:

Look for any errors mentioning enum types or the handle_new_user function.
